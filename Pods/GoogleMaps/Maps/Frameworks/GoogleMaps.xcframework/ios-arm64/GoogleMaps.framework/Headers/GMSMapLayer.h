/*
 * The following layer properties and constants describe the camera properties that may be animated
 * on the custom model layer of a GMSMapView with Core Animation. For simple camera control and
 * animation, please see the helper methods in GMSMapView+Animation.h, and the camera object
 * definition within GMSCameraPosition.h.
 *
 * Changing layer properties triggers an implicit animation, e.g.:-
 *   mapView_.layer.cameraBearing = 20;
 *
 * An explicit animation, replacing the implicit animation, may be added after changing the
 * property, for example:
 * <pre>
 *   CAMediaTimingFunction *curve = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName:
 *                                   kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut];
 *   CABasicAnimation *animation =
 *       [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:kGMSLayerCameraBearingKey];
 *   animation.duration = 2.0f;
 *   animation.timingFunction = curve;
 *   animation.toValue = @20;
 *   [mapView_.layer addAnimation:animation forKey:kGMSLayerCameraBearingKey];
 * </pre>
 *
 * To control several implicit animations, Core Animation's transaction support may be used, for
 * example:
 * <pre>
 *   [CATransaction begin];
 *   [CATransaction setAnimationDuration:2.0f];
 *   mapView_.layer.cameraBearing = 20;
 *   mapView_.layer.cameraViewingAngle = 30;
 *   [CATransaction commit];
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that these properties are not view-based. Please see "Animating View and Layer Changes
 * Together" in the <a
 * href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/windowsviews/conceptual/viewpg_iphoneos/AnimatingViews/AnimatingViews.html">
 * View Programming Guide for iOS</a>.

 * GMSMapLayer is a custom subclass of CALayer, provided as the layer class on GMSMapView. This

 * defined on GMSMapView.
 *
 * Modifying or animating these properties will typically interrupt any current gesture on
 * GMSMapView, e.g., a user's pan or rotation. Similarly, if a user performs an enabled gesture
 * during an animation, the animation will stop 'in-place' (at the current presentation value).
